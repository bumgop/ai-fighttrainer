# Train Your Kombat - Product Overview

## Project Purpose
An adaptive fighting game training system built in Godot 4 Mono (C#). This is a solo portfolio project that uses short, WarioWare-style minigames to train fighting game fundamentals and analyze player performance using telemetry and ML-assisted analytics.

**This is NOT a full fighting game.**

## Key Features
- **WarioWare-Style Minigames**: Short, focused training exercises for fighting game fundamentals
- **Anti-Air Reaction Training**: Tests player timing for anti-air attacks with visual cues and precise timing windows
- **Input System**: Supports fighting game controls (front punch, back punch, front kick, back kick) mapped to J/I/K/L keys
- **Telemetry System**: Comprehensive data collection tracking player performance, timing, and outcomes
- **ML Analytics**: Python-based analysis system (file-based exchange with Godot)
- **Session Management**: Organized training sessions with unique identifiers and structured data logging

## Target Users
- Fighting game players looking to improve reaction times
- Competitive players training specific scenarios
- Players wanting to practice fundamental skills through focused exercises

## Use Cases
